# Dataset-For-Academic-Evaluation
Contain datasets for Chinese university academic evalution.

Datasets are collected by using a web crawler. Every category contains a 'processed' dir, which we use for our paper, and a 'raw' dir, which contains the raw data. Because raw data is too big, we did not include it in this repo.
